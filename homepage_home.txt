                Stress can play a positive or negative role in our lives depending on its severity.
                While stress can motivate us to get to work (much like how it is now motivating me to do this project),
                too much stress can also paralyze us or otherwise impair our daily functioning.

                Additionally, therapy is not only for those in crisis; situational stressors can also be worked through with a therapist even if you consider yourself generally mentally healthy.
